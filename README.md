## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

* **Frontend:**
    * [React](https://react.dev/) -  JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    * [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) -  For navigation within the app.
    * [Material UI](https://mui.com/) -  UI component library for React.
    * [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) -  Simple and fast state management.
* **Backend:**
    * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) -  JavaScript runtime environment.
    * [Express](https://expressjs.com/) -  Web application framework for Node.js.
    * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) -  NoSQL database.
    * [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) -  MongoDB object modeling tool.  (`backend/models/product.model.js`)
    * [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) -  Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```
2.  **Backend Setup:**

    * Navigate to the `backend` directory:

        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```

    * Install dependencies:

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your MongoDB connection string:

        ```
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        PORT=5000  # or any other port
        ```

    * Start the backend server:

        ```bash
        npm run start
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**

    * Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```

    * Install dependencies:

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

    * Start the frontend development server:

        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

    * The frontend should be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite uses).


##  Important Notes

* Ensure MongoDB is installed and running before starting the backend server.
* The `.env` file in the `backend` directory is crucial for storing sensitive information like the MongoDB connection string.  **Do not commit this file to version control.**
* The frontend assumes the backend server is running on `/api/products`.  Adjust the proxy settings in `frontend/package.json` if needed, or use environment variables for the API URL.
* This is a basic application and can be extended with features like authentication, pagination, search, and more robust error handling.

##  Dependencies

Refer to the `package.json` files in the `backend` and `frontend` directories for a complete list of dependencies and their versions.
